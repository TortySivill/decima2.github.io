      <description>Defining AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine to recreate human behaviour. Machine Learning (which describes algorithms like neaural networks) is a subset of AI.
Machines or Brains? Machine Learning replicates the human ability to learn from experience. A Neural Network algorithm constructs a network of nodes whose connections act like the nuerons in our brain.
When we ask our algorithm to perfom a task, distinguish between images of cats and dogs for example, we feed a large number of examples into the network which uses different layers of nodes to learn the patterns and rules which help to differentiate the images.</description>
